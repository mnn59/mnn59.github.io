Modular programming is a key concept in software development where the program consists of code modules that are designed and implemented independently. This approach accelerates the development process and enhances scalability of the final product. Modules, however, are often written by third parties, aggravating security concerns such as stealing confidential information, tampering with sensitive data, and executing malicious code.
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) are concrete examples of employing modular programming. Any user can develop TAP applications by connecting trigger and action services, and publish them on public repositories. In the presence of malicious application makers, users cannot trust applications written by third parties, which can threaten users’ and platform’s security.</p>
<p style="margin-top: -2.5%;">
We present SandTrap, a novel runtime monitor for JavaScript that can be used to securely integrate third-party applications. SandTrap enforces fine-grained access control policies at the levels of module, API, value, and context. We instantiate SandTrap to IFTTT, Zapier, and Node-RED, three popular JavaScript-driven TAPs, and illustrate how it enforces various policies on a set of benchmarks while incurring a tolerable runtime overhead. We also prove soundness and transparency of the monitoring framework on an essential model of Node-RED.</p>
<p style="margin-top: -2.5%;">
Furthermore, nontransitive policies have been recently introduced as a natural fit for coarse-grained information-flow control where labels are specified at the level of modules. The flow relation does not need to be transitive, resulting in nonstandard noninterference and enforcement mechanism. We develop a lattice encoding to prove that nontransitive policies can be reduced to classical transitive policies. We also devise a lightweight program transformation that leverages standard flow-sensitive information-flow analyses to enforce nontransitive policies more permissively.</p>

Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) play a vital role in fulfilling the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) by seamlessly connecting otherwise unconnected devices and services. While enabling novel and exciting applications across a variety of services, security and privacy issues must be taken into consideration because TAPs essentially act as persons-in-the-middle between trigger and action services. The issue is further aggravated since the triggers and actions on TAPs are mostly provided by third parties extending the trust beyond the platform providers.
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
Node-RED, an open-source JavaScript-driven TAP, provides the opportunity for users to effortlessly employ and link nodes via a graphical user interface. Being built upon Node.js, third-party developers can extend the platform's functionality through publishing nodes and their wirings, known as flows.</p>
<p style="margin-top: -2.5%;">
This paper proposes an essential model for Node-RED, suitable to reason about nodes and flows, be they benign, vulnerable, or malicious. We expand on attacks discovered in recent work, ranging from exfiltrating data from unsuspecting users to taking over the entire platform by misusing sensitive APIs within nodes. We present a formalization of a runtime monitoring framework for a core language that soundly and transparently enforces fine-grained allowlist policies at module-, API-, value-, and context-level. We introduce the monitoring framework for Node-RED that isolates nodes while permitting them to communicate via well-de ned API calls complying with the policy specified for each node.</p>

Nontransitive Noninterference (NTNI) and Nontransitive Types (NTT) are a new security condition and enforcement for policies, which in contrast to Denning's classical lattice model, assume no transitivity of the underlying flow relation. Nontransitive security policies are a natural fit for coarse-grained information-flow control where labels are specified at module rather than variable level of granularity.
<p style="margin-top: -0.1%;">
While the nontransitive and transitive policies pursue different goals and have different intuitions, this paper demonstrates that nontransitive noninterference can be in fact reduced to classical transitive noninterference. We develop a power-lattice encoding that establishes a precise relation between NTNI and classical noninterference. Our results make it possible to clearly position the new NTNI characterization with respect to the large body of work on noninterference. Further, we devise a lightweight program transformation that enables us to leverage standard flow-sensitive information-flow analyses to enforce nontransitive policies. We demonstrate several immediate benefits of our approach, both theoretical and practical. First, we improve the permissiveness over (while retaining the soundness of) the nonstandard NTT enforcement. Second, our results naturally generalize to a language with intermediate input and outputs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical benefits by leveraging state-of-the-art flow-sensitive tool JOANA to enforce nontransitive policies for Java programs.</p>

Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) seamlessly connect a wide variety of otherwise unconnected devices and services, ranging from IoT devices to cloud services and social networks. TAPs raise critical security and privacy concerns because a TAP is effectively a “person-in-the-middle” between trigger and action services. Third-party code, routinely deployed as “apps” on TAPs, further exacerbates these concerns. This paper focuses on JavaScript-driven TAPs. We show that the popular IFTTT and Zapier platforms and an open-source alternative Node-RED are susceptible to attacks ranging from exfiltrating data from unsuspecting users to taking over the entire platform. We report on the changes by the platforms in response to our findings and present an empirical study to assess the implications for Node-RED. Motivated by the need for a secure yet flexible way to integrate third-party JavaScript apps, we propose SandTrap, a novel JavaScript monitor that securely combines the Node.js vm module with fully structural proxy-based two-sided membranes to enforce fine-grained access control policies. To aid developers, SandTrap includes a policy generation mechanism. We instantiate SandTrap to IFTTT, Zapier, and Node-RED and illustrate on a set of benchmarks how SandTrap enforces a variety of policies while incurring a tolerable runtime overhead.

Secure Multi-Execution (SME) proves to be a successful technique for
enforcing noninterference. A security mechanism based on SME schedules and
executes multiple copies of a given program, one copy for each security
level, and controls the input/output operations of the copies in a certain
manner. A main challenge in devising such mechanisms is to achieve precision,
which basically stipulates that changes to the executions of secure programs
must be as minimal as possible. Although research in this area has yielded
interesting results, the proposed mechanisms do not attain an acceptable
level of precision even for the security policies that are weakly sensitive
to the timing behavior of programs. This paper proposes a sound and highly
precise mechanism for a strong timing-sensitive noninterference. Using a
specific round-robin-like scheduler, the mechanism indeed arrives at a
highest level of precision demanding that the relative order of input/output
events from different security levels should be preserved.

Rapid advances in the field of medical imaging are revolutionizing medicine. For example,
the diseases diagnosis with the help of computers, where the segmentation of medical
images plays an important role, has become more accurate. Although CNN-based methods
have achieved excellent performance in recent years, but due to the intrinsic locality of
convolution operations, they cannot learn explicit global and long-range semantic information
well. Given the increased interest in self-attention mechanisms in computer vision and
their ability to overcome this problem, the TransUNet architecture was proposed as the first
medical image segmentation framework using Vision Transformer as a strong encoder in a
U-shaped architecture.
TransUNet achieves good results compared to different architectures; therefore, in this project,
we use it as the base model that has a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture. this architecture
is able to leverage both detailed high-resolution spatial information from CNN features and
the global context encoded by Transformers. All experiments are conducted on Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB and Ph2 datasets. First, we reproduce the results in the original paper, and
then we proceed to improve the architecture by making appropriate changes and check the
results. Some of these changes have been successful and others have been unsuccessful. Finally,
we created a web-based system based on the new architecture.
